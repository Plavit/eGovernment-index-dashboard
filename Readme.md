A simple Python and Dash Plotly app that visualizes hard-to-process data from eGov indexes by the European Union and the United Nations. This project started off as a part of a semestral assignment at FIT, Czech Technical University and was finalized as part of a Diploma Thesis at Charles University.

It is currently only available in Czech, but is quite self explanatory.
