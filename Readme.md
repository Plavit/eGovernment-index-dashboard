\
A simple Python and Dash Plotly app that visualizes hard-to-process data from eGov indexes by the European Union and the United Nations. This project started off as a part of a semestral assignment at FIT, Czech Technical University and later used during further research at the Charles University in Prague and at the Univeristy of Cambridge

## Mutations
This project has been split into several variations over time. Different repositories contain different versions based on the same original idea. There are currently two repositories:
-  [`eGovernment-index-dashboard`](https://github.com/Plavit/eGovernment-index-dashboard),  the original main working version, currently containing a czech mutation used for my diploma thesis
-  [`eGovernment-index-dashboard-international`](https://github.com/Plavit/eGovernment-index-dashboard-international), the version adapted for some English publications

### This version (`eGovernment-index-dashboard`)

It is currently only available in Czech, but is quite self explanatory.
