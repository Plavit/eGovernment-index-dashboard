\
A simple Python and Dash Plotly app that visualizes hard-to-process data from eGov indexes by the European Union and the United Nations. This project started off as a part of a semestral assignment at FIT, Czech Technical University and later used during further research at the Charles University in Prague and at the Univeristy of Cambridge

## Mutations
Different forks contain different versions. There are currently three branches:
-  `eGovernment-index-dashboard`, the original main working version, currently containing a czech mutation used for my diploma thesis
-  `eGovernment-index-dashboard-international`, the version adapted for some English publications

### This version (`eGovernment-index-dashboard`)

It is currently only available in Czech, but is quite self explanatory.

## Deployment
To run locally:

1) Get requirements in requirements.txt through
`npm install`
2) Run the app with:
`$ python app.py`
